# Fujara CPU test for macOS (Apple silicon). Double-click to run.
#
# Run it twice:
#   1st run: downloads the Open-XY SDK (pinned commit), Fujara and Daath, fetches
#            the SDK's pinned Blackfin tools, asks for your stock OP-XY OS 1.2.1
#            os.ldr, builds a profiling test firmware holding both machines (Daath
#            keeps its engine number, so Daath projects still open), and shows
#            how to install it.
#   2nd run (after installing and restarting the OP-XY): runs the SDK's CPU
#            benchmark three times over USB MIDI and reports Fujara and Daath.
#
# Everything lives in ~/Library/Application Support/OPXY-SDK/. Your firmware
# stays in its private/ folder and is never uploaded anywhere. This script
# never writes to the OP-XY: you copy the files and write the OS yourself.
# It follows the SDK's docs/build.md and docs/profiling.md.
