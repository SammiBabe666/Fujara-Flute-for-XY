# Fujara CPU test for Mac (no typing)

`Fujara CPU Test.command` builds a profiling test firmware for your OP-XY and
then measures Fujara's CPU cost on the device: the SDK's official measurement
(docs/profiling.md), with dialogs instead of typed commands. A Terminal window
shows progress while it runs; you never type in it.

Needs an Apple-silicon Mac, Python 3.11 or newer from python.org, your stock
OP-XY OS 1.2.1 `os.ldr`, a USB cable and OpenMTP for copying files.

## Get it

Download [Fujara-CPU-Test-mac.zip](Fujara-CPU-Test-mac.zip) and double-click it
to unzip. The first time, macOS blocks scripts from the internet:
right-click the file, choose **Open**, then **Open** again. On macOS 15 or
later, if there is no Open button, choose **Done**, then open **System Settings
→ Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** next to the file's name.

## Run it

1. **First run: build.** It downloads the Open-XY SDK and Fujara, fetches the
   SDK's Blackfin tools, asks you to pick your `os.ldr` (it checks it is the
   exact stock 1.2.1 file) and builds the test firmware. Then it opens the
   folder of files to install and shows the steps:
   te-boot (hold COM while switching on) → track 3 dev menu → track 2 mtp file
   transfer (mac) → copy with OpenMTP → track 2 exit → track 5 write os → power
   cycle.
2. **Second run: measure.** With the OP-XY started normally on the test
   firmware and connected by USB, double-click again and choose **Measure now**.
   It runs the benchmark three times (about 2 minutes each; don't touch the
   OP-XY) and shows the result. The report opens as `report.md`.
3. **Afterwards**, restart the OP-XY without saving and reinstall your usual
   firmware from the Open-XY builder: the test firmware holds only Fujara.

Files go in `~/Library/Application Support/OPXY-SDK/`: the SDK and Fujara in
`src/`, your OS, the build and the measurements in `private/`. Nothing is
uploaded. Send back `report.md` and `catalog-cpu.json` to complete the audit;
keep the capture folders private (they can contain your device's serial number).
A log is kept at `~/Library/Application Support/OPXY-SDK/fujara-cpu-test.log`.

The result is a percentage of the stock 580,352-cycle audio block for one
Fujara voice at its heaviest setting. At or below 3.5% is the SDK's
recommendation. It does not by itself prove a busy project won't drop audio:
also do the listening test in [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](../../RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).
